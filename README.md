# final-project

## Project Description

1. We will be working with datasets that display information about an NBA season including game statistics, player names, etc. The data was sourced from and collected through a .csv file on a website called **MySportsFeeds**.

2. Our target audience is sports enthusiasts (specifically NBA) and potentially sports analysts, or recruiters, who are interested in a specific team. The data will give the statistic of the number of NBA players born in each state, filtered by team. Another piece of data will show the colleges that the number of players attended, filtered by team.

3. Question 1 - How many professional basketball players were born in each state? Filter by team.

Question 2 - What is the rank of each NBA players? Who are the top 3 2017-2018 NBA players?

Question 3 - How many players in the NBA attended each college? Filter by team.

## Technical Description

1. We are getting our data from MySportsFeeds and the data is in the form of a .csv file.

2. We think we are going to have to filter down the data for sure. One weird thing is that in the first .csv file we acquired, there are weird hashtags in certain rows/cols so we will probably have to reformat this. We will also need to figure out what certain columns signify because it may not be entirely clear.

3. We will be using the **_plotly_** library to visualize data on maps. Besides this, I believe all other libraries we will use will be standard for this class.

4. We anticipate that it will be hard to stay on track and we might lose track of time so we will have to be focused and work on this project early. Also, everyone's schedules are different so it might be hard to meet up and work on the project in the same space.
